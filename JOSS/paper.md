# Summary

In their works, @WilsonCowan presented a model, later developed by @Amari, named Neural Field Equations (NFE). @Bressloff:minibook and @Coombes:WavesBumps, summarise the main theoretical results and enumerate a wide variety of neurological phenomena that can be described by these equations. Such as working memory [@Laing:WM], travelling waves, etc. The model in study is given by
\begin{equation}\label{eq:NFE}
  \alpha \frac{\partial V}{\partial t}\left(\mathbf{x},t\right) = I\left(\mathbf{x},t\right) - V\left(\mathbf{x},t\right) + \int_{\Omega} K\left(||\mathbf{x}-\mathbf{y}||_2\right)S\big[V\left(\mathbf{y},t\right)\big]\,\,d^k\mathbf{y},
\end{equation}
with $\Omega=[-\frac{L}{2},\frac{L}{2}]^k$ with $k=1,2$ and $||.||_2$ the euclidean norm; $V(\mathbf{x},t)$ is the membrane potential at point $\mathbf{x} \in \Omega$ at time $t$; $I(\mathbf{x},t)$ is the external input applied to the neural field; $K\left(||\mathbf{x}-\mathbf{y}||_2\right)$ is the average strength of connectivity between neurons located at points $\mathbf{x}$ and $\mathbf{y}$ in a homogeneous neural field. When the coupling is positive (resp. negative) the synapses are excitatory (resp. inhibitory); $S(V)$ is the firing rate function, which converts the potential to the respective firing rate result; And $\alpha$ is the constant decay rate. The equation is coupled with the initial condition $V(\mathbf{x},0) = V_0(\mathbf{x})$.

One of the improvements to consider in \autoref{eq:NFE}, is to take into account the time taken by the stimulus to travel from neurons at $\mathbf{y}$ to the ones at $\mathbf{x}$, leading to the delayed equation,
\begin{equation}\label{eq:dNFE}
  \alpha \frac{\partial V}{\partial t}\left(\mathbf{x},t\right) = I\left(\mathbf{x},t\right) - V\left(\mathbf{x},t\right) + \int_{\Omega} K\left(||\mathbf{x}-\mathbf{y}||_2\right)S\big[V\left(\mathbf{y},t-d\left(\mathbf{x},\mathbf{y}\right)\right)\big]\,\,d^k\mathbf{y},
\end{equation}
where $d\left(\mathbf{x},\mathbf{y}\right)=\frac{||\mathbf{x}-\mathbf{y}||_2}{v}$ represents the delay, which is assumed to only depend on the distance and on the transmission speed $v$. If $v$ is sufficiently high, $d$ can be neglected and \autoref{eq:dNFE} is reduced to \autoref{eq:NFE}. Moreover, $V$ satisfies the initial condition $V(\mathbf{x},t_0)=V_0(\mathbf{x},t_0),\,\,t_0\in\left[-\tau_{max},\,\,0\right]$, wherein $\tau_{max}$ is the maximum delay correspondent to $\Omega$.

@KuehnRiedler considered the stochasticity inherent to neuronal interactions, and presented a spectral method to stochastic non-delayed NFE with additive white noise and spatial correlation. `NeuralFieldEq.jl` proposes to efficiently solve NFE in the mentioned scenarios, and in stochastic neural fields with finite transmission speeds,
\begin{align}\label{eq:dSNFE}
    \alpha\, dV\left(\mathbf{x},t\right) =& \left[I\left(\mathbf{x},t\right) - V\left(\mathbf{x},t\right) + \int_{\Omega}K\left(||\mathbf{x}-\mathbf{y}||_2\right)S\big[V\left(\mathbf{y},t-d\left(\mathbf{x},\mathbf{y}\right)\right)\big]\,\,d^2\mathbf{y}\right]dt + \nonumber \\
    & \epsilon dW\left(\mathbf{x},t\right),
\end{align}
whereas $\epsilon$ is the additive noise level and $W$ is a $Q$-Wiener process. With $V(\mathbf{x},t_0)=V_0(\mathbf{x},t_0),\,\,t_0\in\left[-\tau_{max},\,\,0\right]$ and $V_0$ is a given stochastic process.

# Statement of need

Studies suggest that these equations can be applied to cognitive robotics. The architecture of autonomous robots, able to interact with other agents in solving a mutual task, is strongly inspired by the processing principles and the neuronal circuitry in the primate brain [@ErlhagenBicho]. Furthermore, recent efforts made by @FerreiraEtAl:RapidLearning show a necessity of efficient numerical methods capable of computing NFE in real time, in order to endow robots with working memory mechanisms.

The common numerical methods for Neural Field Equations use the classical quadrature methods, which have $\mathcal{O}\left(N^{2k}\right)$ complexity, where $k$ is the dimension of the domain, therefore, they do not scale well. In the case of non-delayed equations, one can directly apply Discrete Fourier Transforms (and, consequently, Fast Fourier Transforms, which require $\mathcal{O}\left(N^k\log^k N\right)$ operations), to compute the numerical solution. However, when $v<\infty$, the integral term is not a convolution, so such techniques cannot be used. Motivated by this issue, @HuttRougier:2 proposed a novel numerical scheme, where the authors bypassed this issue by rewriting the integral in a suitable way, in order to use FFT to efficiently approximate delayed NFE.

`NeuralFieldEq.jl` aims to enhance the method derived in [@HuttRougier:2] and implemented by @Simulator, and adapt to the stochastic scenario presented by @KuehnRiedler. The solver uses Real Fast Fourier Transforms (RFFT) provided by @fftw, which allows to greatly reduce the overall computations. And is written in `Julia` [@Julia], which can be performant like low-level languages without sacrificing the usual features of high-level languages. Furthermore, `NeuralFieldEq.jl` is built to handle NFE in the scenarios aforementioned and their respective combinations, i.e. non-delayed or delayed equations in deterministic or stochastic 1D or 2D neural fields.

@SequeiraLima exploited this versatility and efficiency to study stochastic neural fields where low transmission velocities play an important role, facilitating the exploration of new ideas and experiments, that could not be easily done using quadrature methods.

# Package usage

`NeuralFieldEq.jl` is divided in:
1. Specifying parameters, initial condition and functions by using the structures `Input1D` or `Input2D`:
  -  The functions are defined as:
    - External input: `I(x,t)` or `I(x,y,t)`;
    - Kernel: `K(x)` or `K(x,y)`;
    - Firing rate: `S(V)`.
  - The initial condition can be constant or a function. In the latter case, must be defined as `V0(x)` or `V0(x,y)`;
  - The parameters to specify are: `a`-$\alpha$, `v`-velocity, `L`-domain length, `N`-number of spatial nodes, `T`-time span and `n`-number of time steps;
  - The order of the inputs in `Input1D`/`Input2D` must be: `nf = Input1D(a,v,V0,L,N,T,n,I,K,S);`;
  - **Remark:** Currently, to work with the non-delayed problem, the velocity to insert must satisfy the condition: $v>\frac{L}{\sqrt{2}\Delta t}$ in 2D and $v>\frac{L}{2\Delta t}$ in 1D.

2. Preparing the NFE through function `probNFE`. Example: `NFE = probNFE(nf)`;

3. Solving the equation using `solveNFE`:
  - Specify an array with the time instants to save the solution. Example: `tj = [t1,t2,t3]`;
  - Compute deterministic solution: `Vdet = solveNFE(NFE,tj)`;
  - Compute stochastic solution with noise magnitude `eps`, spatial correlation `xi` for `np` trajectories: `Vsto = solveNFE(NFE,tj,eps,xi,np)`;
  - **Remark:** Currently, the default value for `xi` is $0.1$. `Vsto = solveNFE(NFE,tj,eps,np)` computes the stochastic solution with `xi=0.1`.

4. Handling the solution:
  - The output of `solveNFE` is a callable object:
    - Deterministic solution at a time instant. Example: `Vdet(t1)`;
    - $p^{th}$ trajectory at a time instant. Example: `Vsto(t1,p)`;
    - Mean stochastic solution at a time instant. Example: `Vsto(t1)`;
    - Return spatial vector: `Vdet.x`.

# Example and code performance

The example shown below is adapted from @Kulikov1D
```julia
using NeuralFieldEq, Plots
I(x,t) = -2.89967 + 8.0*exp(-x^2/(2.0*3^2)) - 0.5
K(x) = 2*exp(-0.08*sqrt(x^2))*(0.08*sin(pi*sqrt(x^2)/10)+cos(pi*sqrt(x^2)/10))
S(V) = V<=0.0 ? 0.0 : 1.0 # Heaviside function
a  = 1.0  # Constant decay      
v  = 20.0 # Finite axonal speed
V0 = 0.0  # Initial condition
L  = 100  # Domain length
N  = 512  # Number of nodes to discretise space
T  = 20.0 # Time span
n  = 200  # Number of nodes to discretise time

nf  = Input1D(a,v,V0,L,N,T,n,I,K,S); # 1st step
NFE = probNFE(nf) # 2nd step
tj  = [5.0,10.0,20.0]  # Choose instants where the sol is saved
V   = solveNFE(NFE,tj) # 3rd step, compute deterministic solution

Vsto  = solveNFE(NFE,tj,0.05,100)      # eps = 0.05. xi = 0.1. 100 paths
Vsto2 = solveNFE(NFE,tj,0.05,100,0.15) # xi = 0.15

# Handling the solutions
V(10.0)     # Returns the deterministic solution at t=10.0
Vsto(20.0)  # Returns the mean stochastic solution at t=20.0
Vsto(5.0,4) # Returns the 4th trajectory at t=5.0

x = V.x # Returns the spatial vector
plot(x,[V(1),Vsto(1),Vsto(1,4)])
